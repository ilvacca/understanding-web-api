# Understanding WebAPIs architectures with Python, Flask & SQLite/SQLAlchemy packages

## Introduction
Any software is nowadays embedded between Web Servers and WebAPIs. Communication between services, applications and (web) apps often takes place using **RESTful HTTP protocols**.

The first Python approaches to this world usually occur with **Flask**. A **micro-framework** that - _fortunately_ - allows us to create web applications potentially **far from the monolithic style**.
In fact, when the application starts to become more robust, it emerges the need to **define** and **design an architecture**.

In this repository a small collection of **best practices** and examples of **architectural patterns** to promote the orderly development of WebAPIs.

## Examples
Below is an illustration of the WebAPI examples listed in this repository.

---

### 1. Our first Flask server
This is the easiest example that can be realized in Flask: a website with a single route.

#### 1.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | / |

---

### 2. Multiple routing
In this example we extend the possibilities of our website by integrating a second page (_ex. Blog_).

#### 2.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | /``` |
| Blog | /blog``` |

---

### 3a. Multiple routing with HTML
It is possible to integrate HTML code into the responses of our website.

#### 3a.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` |
| Blog | ```/blog``` |

---

### 3b. Multiple routing with HTML template
When the web page becomes very complex and starts integrating HTML, CSS or JS code, it may be useful to refer to templates.

#### 3b.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` |
| Blog | ```/blog``` |

---

### 4. Passing arguments
Communication between the users and the website can take place in both directions: inward and outward.
We can pass parameters using a HTTP GET request.

#### 4.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` |
| Blog | ```/blog``` |
| Welcome Page | ```/welcome/ <your-name-here>``` |

---

### 5. Responding with a JSON (I)
WebApi usually respond through JSON. Let's integrate a small dataset inside the server.

#### 5.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE |
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` |
| Welcome Page | ```/welcome/<your-name-here>``` |
| Data | ```/api/data``` |

**Architecture:** Flat.
**Data access:** variable.

---

### 6. Passing arguments in a compact way
The number of parameters that are passed to a WebAPI, using the methodology proposed in the example (4), can become many and difficult to interpret. 
The approach shown in this example allows to communicate with a WebAPI in a flexible and easily manageable way.

#### 6.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| Welcome Page Structured | ```/welcome/<your-name-here>``` |
| Welcome Page Unstructured | ```/welcome?user=<your-name-here>``` | 
| Data | /api/data | 

**Architecture:** Flat.
**Data access:** variable.

---

### 7. Responding with a JSON (II)
In this example we join the experience matured in the examples (5) and (6).

#### 7.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| API - Get all data | ```/api``` |
| API - Query user by ID | ```/api/user?id=<id-here>``` |

**Architecture:** Flat.
**Data access:** variable.

---

### 8. Read data from files
Here we expose readed data from a saved CSV file. Pandas package is used to read and query the data.

#### 8.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| API - Get all data | ```/api``` |
| API - Query user by ID | ```/api/user?id=<id-here>``` |

**Architecture:** Flat.
**Data access:** CSV and Pandas.

---

### 9. Read data from a DB
Usually a Database is more suitable and secure to store and read data. In this case we use the simple SQLite3 package by still using a flat monolithic architecture.

#### 9.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| API - Get all data | ```/api``` |
| API - Query user by ID | ```/api/user?id=<id-here>``` |

**Architecture:** Flat.
**Data access:** DB and SQLite.

---

### 10. An architecture with DAO module (SQLite)
The definition and design of an architecture becomes an increasingly important requirement as WebAPI grows.
In this example, WebAPI is split into a start point, a routing module and a DAO (Data Access Object).

#### 10.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| API - Infos about the API | ```/api``` |
| API - Get all users | ```/api/users``` |
| API - Insert new user | ```/api/newUser?id=<id-here>&name=<name-here>&age=<age-here>``` |

**Architecture:** Main, Routes (Controller) and DAO.
**Data access:** DB and SQLite.

---

### 11. An architecture with DAO and Models (SQLAlchemy)
Here the case of the same WebAPI using the more structured SQLAlchemy package. Here we also included Models to help interact easily with DBs.

#### 11.1. Routes
| NAME | ROUTE | 
|---|---|
| Index | ```/``` | 
| API - Infos about the API | ```/api``` |
| API - Get all users | ```/api/users``` |
| API - Insert new user in DB | ```/api/newUser?id=<id-here>&name=<name-here>&age=<age-here>``` |

**Architecture:** Main, Routes (Controller) and DAO.
**Data access:** DB and SQLAlchemy.
